## Final Project Parameters

CTF on Hack The Box

1. Each student is assigned three boxes for penetration:
    * One = Easy
    * Two = Medium
    * Three = Medium

2. Any captured flags are expected to be demonstrated during the final presentation.
3. Demonstrations and Offensive Security Report are to include each assigned box regardless of completion - Must have tested all three boxes
4. Refer to README.md and [Codefellows 401 class 45 final project guidelines](https://github.com/codefellows/seattle-ops-cyber-401n1/blob/main/class-45/project-guidelines.md)

## Methodology

For execution of pentesting on the final:
1. Network Enumeration
    * List open ports
    * List all services on the port
    * Use multiple tools (cross-reference) to generate the most detailed services per port and vulnerabilities available

2. Vulnerability Scan 
    * Nessus
    * NSE
    * Banner grabbing/service fingerprinting

3. Research all the exploits
    * Detail exploits available

4. Exploits
    * Map exploits to CVSS, CVE, CWE

5. Shell Access
    * Prepare to demonstrate

6. Privilege Escalation 
    *Prepare to demonstrate

7. Post-Exploitation
    * If applicable 

This is a working document to be updated as my methodology grows during the course of this assignment. I am to draw on all of the experience of this course utilizing any tools available with the boundaries of the project guidelines, maintaining ethical practices, and using native tools when possible.
